## Repo Structure

* The [`data`](data) folder contains all experiment result data we have for RQ1, RQ2, RQ3 in our paper. For a detailed walkthrough, please refer to the [README](data/README.md) under that directory.

* The [`self-reports`](self-reports) folder provides example code snippets for testing LLMs on the self-report questionnaires used in our paper, including BFI and SRQ. For more details, see the [README](self-reports/README.md) under that directory.

* The [`behavioral_tasks`](behavioral_tasks) folder provides example code snippets for testing LLMs on the behavioral tasks described in our paper, including risk-taking, sycophancy, and others. For more details, see the [README](behavioral_tasks/README.md) under that directory.

## Contributions

We **welcome contributions**. Please feel free to open a PR to add new self-reports, behavioral tasks, or additional LLMs. In your PR, include a brief description along with any relevant details (e.g., extra setup steps, generated results, acknowledgments to prior work, etc.). For PRs proposing other improvements or new directions, please also provide a short explanation of the motivation behind your contribution. We encourage you to start a discussion with the maintainers before submitting major changes, to help align efforts and minimize unnecessary work.
