## behavioral_tasks  

This folder contains example code snippets for the four behavioral tasks used in our paper.  

## Task Data  
- **Risk-Taking** : the data is directly generated in the notebooks.  
- **Honesty**, **IAT**, and **Sycophancy**: the data can be found in the [datasets](datasets) folder.

Notes:  
- For **IAT**, our code and data reference the work *"[Measuring Implicit Bias in Explicitly Unbiased Large Language Models](https://github.com/baixuechunzi/llm-implicit-bias)"*.  
- For **Honesty**, we use the **norm300** dataset with additional synthetic augmentation.
